# Coding Exercise

In this exercise we'd like you to implement an editable text view with source
editor-like line numbers.


## App Requirements

+ A macOS application created in Xcode with Swift 3 or later.

+ The main window contains a text editor that resizes to fit the window.

+ A text file containing some starting text should be included in the app's
bundle, and its contents loaded into the text editor when the app starts.

+ The text editor supports selection, copy/paste, undo/redo, scrolling, and
spell-checking. (Hint: NSTextView provides this support by default.)

+ Each line (separated by `\n`, `\r`, or `\r\n`) is marked with its line
number. The line number is not obstructed by the line's contents, effectively
appearing in a left-hand gutter, base-line aligned with the line's contents.

+ The text view's contents and the line numbers are displayed with a monospaced
font.

+ Line numbers are neither selectable nor editable.

## Code Requirements

+ Custom methods and object definitions are documented using documentation
comments (e.g. `///`).

+ No third-party frameworks are used.


## Time

We expect you to spend no more than 2-3 hours on this project. However, don't
worry if you're not able to complete all the requirements in the given amount
of time. Instead, prioritize what you think is most important and document why
you made those decisions.
